# Password strength bar

This simple application implements a password strength bar using React.js.

It was implemented with React 16.8.6 and node.js, where node simplifies
testing and serving the page that has the component.

Future versions will *not* need node.js to check the component out.

# Scripts

This application follows the concepts of [Scripts to rule them all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all). Docker is required to run the scripts. 

Running the app without Docker is also possible. To do that, install the required dependencies
and run the project on your machine.
